      <h1>7 YEARS OLD</h1>
      <p class="singer">(-By Lukas Graham)</p>
      <p>Once I was seven years old, my mama told me</p>
      <p>"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"</p>

      <p class="old1"><strong>| Once I was seven years old |</strong></p>
      <div class="part1">
        <p>It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger</p>
        <p>Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker</p>
        <p>By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor</p>
        <p>Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure</p>

        <p>Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me</p>
        <p>"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely"</p>
      </div>

      <p class="old2"><strong>| Once I was eleven years old |</strong></p>

      <p>I always had that dream, like my daddy before me</p>
      <p>So I started writing songs, I started writing stories</p>
      <p>Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me</p>
      <p>'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me</p>

      <p>Once I was twenty years old, my story got told</p>
      <p>Before the morning sun, when life was lonely</p>
      <p class="old3"><strong>| Once I was twenty years old |</strong></p>

      <div class="part2">
        <p>I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure</p>
        <p>'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major</p>
        <p>I got my boys with me, at least those in favor</p>
        <p>And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later</p>
        <p>Once I was twenty years old, my story got told</p>
        <p>I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me</p>
      </div>
      <p class="old4"><strong>| Once I was twenty years old |</strong></p>

      <p>Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold</p>
      <p>We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming</p>
      <div class="part3">
        <p>Soon we'll be thirty years old</p>
        <p>I'm still learning about life</p>
        <p>My woman brought children for me</p>
        <p>So I can sing them all my songs</p>
        <p>And I can tell them stories</p>
        <p>Most of my boys are with me</p>
        <p>Some are still out seeking glory</p>
        <p>And some I had to leave behind</p>
        <p>My brother, I'm still sorry</p>
      </div>

      <p>Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one</p>
      <p>Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one</p>
      <p>I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once</p>
      <p>I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month</p>
      <p>Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold</p>
      <p>Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?</p>
